# Predicting future frames using retrospective GAN

Part of Winter of GANs

This repository consist of the implementation of CVPR - 2019 paper - Predicting-Future-Frames-using-Retrospective-Cycle-GAN

The link to Paper - https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Kwon_Predicting_Future_Frames_Using_Retrospective_Cycle_GAN_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf

Due to the multistack structure and huge data, the model is currently under training and taking 7700 secs using the kaggle GPU computation.
If you want to continue training, head over to <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17X1LEpAfbxSTK2wfmnG9wYGcaO6oGy6H?usp=sharing">here</a>

Currently we are also working on converting the code to TPU capable training so that the process can be made fast.
